**Project: Take-A-Hike**
As an avid hiker and trail runner, I deeply value exploring new paths. However, the process of discovering new trails can be time-consuming and overwhelming. To streamline this process, I developed Take-A-Hike, a tool that leverages machine learning to recommend trails based on user preferences.

**Challenge:**
Finding new trails to explore efficiently.

**Solution:**
Take-A-Hike utilizes a content-based learning algorithm to identify trails similar to a user's favorite. Key factors considered include distance, elevation gain, difficulty, rating, and various trail attributes (e.g., wildflowers, dog-friendliness). The tool provides a list of five recommended trails, offering both nationwide exploration options and the ability to filter by specific locations.

**Technology:**
+ **Machine Learning:** Content-based learning algorithm
+ **Data:** Trail data sourced from AllTrails (prior to API deprecation)
+ **User Interface:** Streamlit

**Impact:**
+ **Personal:** Streamlined the process of discovering new trails for personal use.
+ **Skill Development:** Gained valuable experience in machine learning implementation and front-end development.

**Future Enhancements:**
+ **Improved User Interface:** Enhance user experience with a more intuitive design, additional filtering options, and embedded trail links.
+ **Data Integration:** Explore alternative data sources and potentially re-integrate with an updated AllTrails API (if available).
+ **Advanced Features:** Incorporate user feedback, explore collaborative filtering, and potentially integrate with mapping services.

**Key Takeaways:**
This project was a rewarding learning experience, fostering problem-solving skills and motivating me to further refine my front-end development capabilities.
