  Hi, I'm Nicki, Analytics Program Manager by day, Grad student by night. Thanks for stopping by.
  <br><br>
  With 15 years of data experience, I get the most satisfaction out of coming up with creative solutions for the most challenging problems. I am always on the look out for opportunities to learn and and teach others. Just as I love exploring the world around me, every dataset is an adventure, full of hidden treasure. I am especially passionate about using data for good.
